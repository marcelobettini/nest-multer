## Cloudinary implementation



```bash
$ npm install cloudinary
```

## Environment vars
Create .env file in root project directory. Then we must install a package and enable environment variables usage. 
```bash
npm install @nestjs/config

```
In order to use the recently installed package we proceed as follows in the <code>app.module.ts</code> file
```bash
import {ConfigModule} from '@nestjs/config'
...
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true })],
  ...

```
* Next we have to set up the environment variables from Cloudinary into the .env file and add the .env to the .gitignore file.
* Then create the <code>src/cloudinary/cloudinary-response.ts</code>
## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
